## Typescript playground

This is a basic ts project I use as a playground when I code.
To run it:

1. clone the project to a folder
2. open it using the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/b?utm_expid=101350005-27.GqBWbOBuSRqlazQC_nNSRg.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.il%2F)
3. I've included the .vscode folder on purpose, so you won't have to define tasks and processes by yourself
4. Press ⇧⌘B to run the Build step - it runs the tsc on "watch" mode, so you can play all the time
5. Press F5 to run the lunch the debug process (It's the only lunch setting set in the launch.json file, so it should work really easy)
6. Switch to the debug console view with ⇧⌘Y

C'est tout. Happy playing!
